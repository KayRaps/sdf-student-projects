# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, I had to clone a simple Instagram profile page, using CSS layout and its diffirent forms of techniques.

### Reflections

So far so good, at first I used to get minor anxiety attacks, when I was reading a code but now I'm building the confidence to read a code, it will get better with time.

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: 
- **Responsive Design**: 
- **Styling Elements**: 

for all the above, I still need more theory and practicals.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:
it was challenging to keep the code constant, I could'nt see those small mistakes, because the code was also long.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: 
I was struggling to make the text hover

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: 
- **Code Optimization**: 
- **Creative Design Choices**:

In need improvement in every one of the areas.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was the most challenging so far but I did learn a lot from it. And I need to learn more about commiting, actually Github as whoel.
